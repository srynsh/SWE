Key features include user authentication, auction room creation, bidding, search functionality, recommendation systems, auction management, and viewing of auction history.

# [Overall Description](#overall-description)
This section offers a comprehensive overview of the system.

## [Product Perspective](#product-perspective)
The Auction Site operates as a standalone web application accessible via standard web browsers. It interfaces with databases for storing user data, auction information, and item details. The system also integrates with external services for authentication, recommendation systems, and payment processing.

## [Product Functions](#product-functions)
### User Management:
- Users can register with the site, providing necessary information for account creation.

- Users can manage their profiles, update information, and reset passwords if needed.

### Auction Room Management:
- Registered users can create new auction rooms, specifying auction types (public or private), duration, and item categories.
- Users can search and browse existing auction rooms based on various criteria such as category, popularity, and end time.
- Auctioneers have the authority to moderate and configure auction rooms, including setting starting bids, reserve prices, and auction rules.

### Bidding Functionality:
- Registered users can place bids on items within active auction rooms.
- The system will support real-time bidding updates and notifications to keep users informed of auction progress.
- Bids will be validated against predefined rules to ensure fairness and integrity.

### Search Feature:

   - User accounts shall be verified via email confirmation to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Users shall have the option to update their profile information, including contact details and preferences.

### Auction Room Management

**Use case 1:** Adding items for auction

**Use case 3:** Make a bid
- *Primary actor:* bidder
- *Pre-condition:* Internet connection, bidder logged in
- *Main scenario:*
   1. The bidder specifies the bid price
