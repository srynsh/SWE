# Overview
## Software
    Our software aims to provide an end-to-end solution for customers participating in online auctions. We provide personalized interfaces for all users taking into account their preferences and auction history. We allow prospective auctioneers to declare items and schedule auctions at their convenience. Our software provides for multiple bidders to join auction rooms, leave auction rooms and bid for items of interest.
## Design
    This document encapsulates our data-flow-diagrams, their abstract inputs and outputs along with the appropriate structured charts and their comprising modules. We also specify each module type and its predicted complexity in the system in terms of cohesiveness and coupling. This document highlight possible bottlenecks and error-prone modules with intuitive reasoning and mathematical analysis. We also consider the tentative lines-of-code (LoC) for every input, transform and output subsystems.
    We summarize our software through an interface sketch comprising of relevant classes, attributes, methods and inheritances.
